# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- This is a job board application built using React and a JSON backend. User can do the following:
  - View jobs and click on one to view it in further detail.
  - Click "More" to view the job description in full.
  - Edit existing jobs.
  - Add new jobs.
  - Delete existing jobs.
